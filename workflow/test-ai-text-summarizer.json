Machine learning models can now perform complex tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and even creative writing. Large language models like GPT-4 have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. These advances are transforming industries from healthcare to finance, enabling new applications that were previously impossible. However, these powerful technologies also raise important questions about ethics, bias, and the future impact on employment and society."
